This is a Chrome Extension that gives you shortcuts on [Messenger.com](https://messenger.com). Second in series, first extension is [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortcutsformessenger/mnbelhdnejkhacghbkepfdhnnhkjfdcm). Needed to have multiple because Chrome only allows 4 shortcuts for an extension. 

- Send sticker: `Control + S`
- Send GIF: `Control + G`

More to come!
